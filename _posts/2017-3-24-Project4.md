title: Demonetization - What did Indians say before and after?
---

**In November 2016 the government of India announced that Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes would not be legal tender from January 1, 2017.**  
  
I'm using Twitter data here to highlight the key issues being discussed related to the Demonetization event. Specifically, I use an old dataset of "tweets" with the tag #demonetization, downloaded via Kaggle, from late November 2016, when the Demonetization was announced. For comparison I also use tweets with the same tag downloaded via the Twitter API in March 2017.
