title: Demonetization of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes in India - what were people saying?
---
I use Twitter data to highlight the key issues being discussed related to the Demonetization event that occurred in India on January 1, 2017. Specifically, I use an old dataset of "tweets" with the tag #demonetization, downloaded via Kaggle, from late November 2016, when the Demonetization was announced. For comparison I also use tweets with the same tag downloaded via the Twitter API in March 2017.
