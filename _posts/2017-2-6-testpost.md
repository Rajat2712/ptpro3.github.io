## Analyzing New York MTA subway turnstile data
The fictional group, WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), wants to leverage data to optimize recruitment efforts at subway stations for an upcoming event. In this project my team used publicly available MTA turnstile data, as well as city demographic data, to recommend the best way to deploy recruitment / promotion teams.

### Initial Assumptions
- For total turnstile traffic, we considered a sum of entries and exits.
- We assumed the gala is being held early in June; thus we used subway data for the 4 weeks of May, 2016.
- We decided to focus the target demographic on women working in the tech industry.
- We further assumed the target demographic will use subway stations near their place of residence; we were not considering major commuter stations as commuters would probably be less likely to attend a gala in the city.
