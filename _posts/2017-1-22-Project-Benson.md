## Analyzing New York MTA subway turnstile data
The fictional group, WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), wants to leverage data to optimize recruitment efforts at subway stations for an upcoming event. In this project my team used publicly available MTA turnstile data to recommend the best way to deploy recruitment/promotion teams.

### Initial Assumptions
- For total turnstile traffic we considered a sum of entries and exits.
- We assumed the gala is being held early in June; thus we used subway data for the 4 weeks of May, 2016.
- We decided to focus the target demographi on women working in the tech industry.
- We further assumed the target demographic will use subway stations near their place of residence; we were not considering major commuter stations as commuters would probably be less likely to attend a Gala in the city.

### Demographics Data

Locate high density residential areas for women working in tech industries (US census data)
Merge the subways stops (City of New York dataset) on the Census data in ArcGIS.
Use MTA data (May 2016) to determine which stops near these locations are the most popular and when to hit those stops

### Using Census data

[heat map issue]

joined census data to station / census tract data
